# ds334_finalProject

For this project I built an app to provide a basic education of the National Parks in the United States. The final shiny app includes a map of all areas managed by the National Park Service that are classified as National Parks. I plotted them on a map using a shape file that I joined with data from a Wikipedia page that included some extra information about these areas. The information pulled from Wikipedia includes the name of the park, its state, the year it was established, its area, the visitor count from 2022, and a brief description of the park. This information appears in the popup window when a park is clicked on and in a data table that is below the map. The app also includes a couple of plots providing more information about the visitor trends for National Parks. One plot allows the user to select which parks they want to compare and creates a line plot showing the visitor counts from 1995 to 2016. This gives the user more control over which parks they are interested and want to learn more about. The second plot only allows for the selection of one park and gives a more in depth look into the visitors for just that park. Given the idea behind the app was to provide a basic education, I also included a file that contains a few basic guiding questions of the information that can be gained using this app. The questions can all be answered through user interaction with the app.
